# The Lights

### Week One

My first experiment putting together an [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) scene, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences.

The purpuse is to practice with Lights and Shadows, and it's interactions with objects and materials.

### Achived

- Implemented shadow component.
- Registering a shader through AFRAME.registerShader() with GLSL code found in A-Frame documentation.

## Would have loved to do

- Continue Moving Light animation, from corner to corner.
- Event set: On click, bounce animations for a-sphere + color change.
